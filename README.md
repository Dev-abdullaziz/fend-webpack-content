# Project 1
This application is intended for the first project in the front-end web development advanced course.

what we've done so far is:
1- Use webpack as our build tool and make two config files one for production and one for development.
2- Declare the entry point for Webpack.
2- Use loaders to handle defferent types of files.
3- Use plugins to enhance our production and development configrations
4- learned Sass and used it in the application.
5- Use an external third party API
6- Use environment variables to hide our API key
